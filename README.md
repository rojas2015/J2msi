# J2msi
package exe to easy installer

    Because the Wix is a command line to perform, the operation is more trouble, 
    so I wrote a Wix to generate the installation package of graphics operations,
    Principle is very simple, the main use of Wix to implement heat Java, candle and light commands, 
    and finally generate the installation files, such as xxx.msi
    This setup can only confirm the licence, select the installation directory,
    uninstall, create a shortcut to the desktop and start bar,
    If you need to be more powerful or rich, you have to research and expand, 
    and now this feature is able to meet the needs of our company project.
    This procedure is simple, the main choice of several resource file path, and then perform.
    You can put the JRE into the installation package, which is independent of the JRE,
    and not the use of the system, that is to say, 
    running the computer has no relationship with the operating environment java.
    You can pack any exe files you can execute.
    Before using Java8 (javaFX) to do a version, that version also can run the jar packaged into exe, 
    and then hit into the installation package MSI,
    but running on the need to install java8,
    And most of the cases are fitted with the java6, 
    so that the java8 version of the javaFX to the java6 is very easy to change to the java6 can only use SWING very painful.
